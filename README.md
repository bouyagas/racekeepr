# RaceKeepr
An app for athletes to plan their race schedules....a replacement for the race spreadsheet. My friends and I run many races during the year and we all pretty much use an excel file to keep track of our races. I thought a cool app for this organization process with some bells and whistles would be fun to create so here's my attempt :)

- Add a race you don't see listed to your race schedule with the race form at the top of the screen
- Add notes to the races you have in your race schedule
